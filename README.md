## About
With this package you can use Eloquent and QueryBuilder with a Firebird database. ðŸ”¥

## Compability 
Support for Laravel 5.5 to 8.x with PHP 7.1+ and Firebird 1.5, 2.5, 3.0.

## Installation

1. Install/enable the Firebird PDO driver for PHP (`pdo_firebird`);
2. Install the package with composer:
```bash
composer require ejetar/laravel-firebird
```
3. As of Laravel 5.5, it is not necessary to inform service providers in `config/app.php`. But if you want to inform, enter the file `config/app.php` and include the class below in the section `providers`:
```php
Ejetar\LaravelFirebird\FirebirdServiceProvider::class
```
4. Declare your connection in section `connections` in file `config/database.php`, using firebird driver:
```php
'firebird' => [
    'driver'         => 'firebird',
    'host'           => env('DB_HOST', 'localhost'),
    'database'       => env('DB_DATABASE','/storage/firebird/APPLICATION.FDB'),
    'username'       => env('DB_USERNAME', 'sysdba'),
    'password'       => env('DB_PASSWORD', 'masterkey'),
    'charset'        => env('DB_CHARSET', 'UTF8'),
    'role'           => 'RDB$ADMIN',
    //'engine_version' => '3.0', //it will be discovered automatically
]
```
If you do not enter `engine_version`, it will be discovered automatically.
